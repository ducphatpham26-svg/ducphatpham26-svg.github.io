    <h1> 8 Ball Pool Rules for Beginners</h1>
    <section>
       <h3>1. Objective of the match</h3>
      <p>- To start the game, the two players must choose a certain group of balls for themselves, <u>Striped and Solid</u>. <br>- Balls numbered 1 to 7 are solid balls, balls numbered 9 to 15 are striped balls. <br>- To end the game, the players must hit all the above balls and pocket the last ball numbered 8.</p>
      <h3> 2. Arrange the marbles</h3>
      <p>- The inside balls will be arranged in a triangle with the 8 ball in the middle of the triangle. <br>- Each type of object ball will have one ball of this type at the top and one ball of the other type at the bottom and the two corners will also be arranged alternately like this one solid ball and one striped ball.</p>
      <h3> 3. Order of opening</h3>
      <p>- The winner of the opening contest will open first. <br>- In this category, the winner of each game will open the next game unless the rules are changed by the 8 ball pool organizer and specifically as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Losing Player Opens</li>
        <li>Players Alternate Openings</li>
        <li>Winning Player Opens</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>4. Legal opening</h3>
      <p>- The player opens with the cue ball placed behind the head rail and pockets the object ball provided that at least four object balls touch the rail. If the shot does not meet the above criteria, it is considered a foul.</p>
      <p>- The next player has the option to continue shooting with the ball in the same position or to ask the referee to re-rack the ball to make the opening or to ask the opponent to re-open.</p>
      <h3>5. Scoring</h3>
      <p>- A player may continue to shoot until he cannot legally pocket any object ball in any group of balls. After pocketing all his balls in the group, he finishes by pocketing the 8 ball.</p>
      <h3>6. Penalty</h3>
      <p>- When a player commits a foul, the next player to take the cue ball will have the right to place the cue ball anywhere on the table. This is meant to prevent players from intentionally committing a foul to put their opponents at a disadvantage.</p>
      <h3>Lost the game</h3>
      <p>- A player is considered to have lost the game if he/she:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fouls the 8 ball into a pocket while there are still object balls in the pool.</li>
        <li>Causes the 8 ball to fall off the board</li>
        <li>Pockets the 8 ball when it is not an object ball</li>
        <li>Pockets the 8 ball in a pocket other than the designated pocket</li>
      </ul>
